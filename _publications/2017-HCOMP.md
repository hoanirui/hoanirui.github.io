excerpt: 'Drafty is a platform that enlists visitorsof an editable dataset to become “user-editors” to help solvethis  problem.  It  records  and  analyzes  user-editors’  within-page interactions to construct user interest profiles, creatinga cyclical feedback mechanism that enables Drafty to targetrequests  for  specific  corrections  from  user-editors.  To  val-idate  the  automatically  generated  user  interest  profiles,  wesurveyed participants who performed self-created tasks withDrafty and found their user interest score was 3.2 higher ondata they were interested in versus data they had no interestin.  Next,  a  7-month  live  experiment  compared  the  efficacyof  user-editor  corrections  depending  on  whether  they  wereasked to review data that matched their interests. Our find-ings suggest that user-editors are approximately 3 times morelikely to provide accurate corrections for data matching theirinterest profiles, and about 2 times more likely to provide cor-rections in the first place.'
