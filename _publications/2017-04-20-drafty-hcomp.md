title: "Drafty: Enlisting Users to be Editors who Maintain Structured Data"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-04-20-drafty-hcomp
excerpt: 'This paper introduces a platform named Drafty, which enlists visitors of an editable dataset to become "user-editors".  It  records and analyzes user-editorsâ€™ within-page interactions to construct user interest profiles, creating a cyclical feedback mechanism that enables Drafty to target requests for specific corrections from user-editors. To validate the automatically  generated user interest profiles, we surveyed participants who performed self-created tasks with Drafty and found their user interest score was 3.2 higher on data they were interested in versus data they had no interest in.  Next, a 7-month live  experiment compared the efficacy of user-editor corrections depending on whether they were asked to review data that matched their interests. Our findings suggest that user-editors are approximately 3 times morelikely to provide accurate corrections for data matching theirinterest profiles, and about 2 times more likely to provide corrections in the first place.'
