Continuous Word Recognition
------
* Performed an HMM-based speech recognition task on the TIMIT speech dataset using the Kaldi toolkit
* Wrote shell scripts to investigate the influences of acoustic features and dynamic features on word error rate



Image Captioning
------
* Used the TensorFlow framework to perform an image captioning task on the MSCOCO dataset
* Constructed an encoder-decoder framework with a CNN encoder and an RNN decoder with GRU and LSTM
* Rewarded for third best project in Machine Learning Practical by IBM



Image Classification
------
* Classified images of handwritten digits and letters from the MNIST and EMNIST datasets using deep neural networks
* Implemented models with different activation functions, weight initialisation strategies, and learning rules



Speaker Independent Digit Recognition
------
* Recorded voiced English digits and parameterised the collected waveform files as MFCCs
* Constructed a speaker-dependent, and -independent speech recogniser using the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK)


Facial Expression Prediction - Kaggle Competition
------
* Used the Toronto Faces dataset to classify faces based on several facial expressions
